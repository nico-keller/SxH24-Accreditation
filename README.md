# Accreditation_Software
This software is intended for the accreditation proccess in START Global events.


The only things that should have to be adapted are both config files.
  - **station_config.json** file states the different types of accreditation stations. This file is necessary. If you have only one
  - station or don't really care about that, then just use a universal station.

  - **config.json** contains important details for the connection with an AirTable database.
